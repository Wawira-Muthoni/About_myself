        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Christine Wawira, a software developer who is passionate about creating innovative solutions and turning ideas <br>
             into reality through programming.
     </p>
     <p>
     As a software developer, I have had the opportunity to work on exciting projects and expand my skills. I have experience with languages <br>
      like HTML,CSS,JavaScript and Python.  <br> But what truly brings me joy is sharing my knowledge and inspiring young minds.
     <br> I strongly believe that introducing kids to programming at an early age not only helps them develop problem-solving skills but also <br>
      nurtures their creativiy and logical thinking. <br>
    It's incredible to witness their enthusiasm and watch them grow as they build their own projects.</p>
    <p>That's why I am really excited about the opportunity to join your school! I would love to contribute my expertise and create a fun intercative  <br>
         learning environment where kids can explore the wonders of coding.</p>
